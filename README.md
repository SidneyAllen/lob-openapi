Working in this repo until we get the first endpoint or two in place.

## what's here and how to work with it

Check out the API tooling Notion page for recommendations for VS Code plugins. Some quick notes:

* The OpenAPI Preview command only works if you invoke it with the base structure file (Lob-API-public.yml) active.
* If you have the stoplight spectral extension installed (v0.2.4), it will run as you type. I find it useful to install it as a CLI as well, as the VS Code plugin can get confused.
